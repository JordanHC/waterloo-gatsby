  SAVE BRITAINS HERITAGE AND THE VICTORIAN SOCIETY OBJECT TO PLANS TO INFILL
  WEST WATERLOO DOCK
---
Two more influential UK heritage groups are objecting to plans to infill historic West Waterloo Dock and build 330 flats on the site. 

SAVE Britain’s Heritage calls on Liverpool City Council to refuse planning application PA 21F/0377.  They cite the “substantially harmful Impact on the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of the UNESCO Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City World Heritage Site (WHS)” from infilling West Waterloo Dock and constructing three, large 4 to 9 storey blocks of flats.  They “support Historic England’s view that the Liverpool’s docks ‘are a finite resource’ of great value to the city’s historic fabric and identity.”  “If approved the application would contravene key duties set out in the National Policy Planning Framework …regarding World Heritage Sites” as well as the City Council’s own guidance. 



The Victorian Society also objects to the application and supports Historic England’s opinion that infill of West Waterloo Dock would harm the OUV of the UNESCO Liverpool WHS.  They highlight that “the Liverpool Docks are the largest and most complete system of historic docks anywhere in the world and…are not simply historic but globally pioneering”.  They also object strongly to “the poor design of the proposed buildings…The proposed elevational treatment of the buildings remains poor in quality…. \[and] ….the current proposals are neither of the highest quality nor respect, respond to or enhance the highly sensitive and important context of the historic WHS and buffer zone.” 



A spokesperson for Save Waterloo Dock said: “We are greatly encouraged that these two highly respected national heritage groups are supporting our efforts to halt the unnecessary destruction of historic Waterloo Dock. We must stop this proposed development or Liverpool stands to lose its hard-won UNESCO WHS designation. Only two other World Heritage sites have been similarly humiliated”



Waterloo Dock dates from 1834 when Jesse Hartley, the world’s first full-time dock engineer, was expanding the docks northwards, and was modified in 1865 – 8 by City Engineer, George F. Lyster.  Three large grain warehouses were built of which only Waterloo Warehouse survives, turning the dock into the largest grain dock in the world. West Waterloo Dock was also the main point of departure throughout the rest of the 19th Century for emigrants to the “New World”.



Waterloo Warehouse is a protected Grade II listed building located in the UNESCO WHS of which East Waterloo Dock forms a part; West Waterloo Dock lies in the WHS Buffer Zone. In 2012 UNESCO placed the Liverpool WHS on its “In danger” list due to the Liverpool Waters development. It is one of only four endangered World Heritage sites amongst the 531in Europe and North America.



SAVE Britain’s Heritage is a strong, independent voice in conservation that has been fighting for threatened historic buildings and sustainable reuses since 1975. 



The Victorian Society is the charity championing Victorian and Edwardian buildings in England and Wales.  



Save Waterloo Dock is a local neighbourhood association seeking to ensure that development of Waterloo Dock is appropriate and not destructive.
