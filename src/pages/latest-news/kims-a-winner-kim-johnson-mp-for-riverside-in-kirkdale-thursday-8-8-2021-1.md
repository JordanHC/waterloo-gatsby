Kim and her  Team visited Kirkdale this week touching base with grassroots community organisations. 

What a splash they made delighting residents with a visit to see for herself the Historic West Waterloo Dock.

Kim was unequivocal in her support to stop the destruction of West Waterloo Dock and expressed concern about the unaesthetic design of the recent new builds on Jesse Hartley Way near to the grade II listed Waterloo Warehouse. 

It lifted the spirits of residents who continue to resist the planning application to destroy the dock, which is a major industrial heritage asset by infilling it to build 330 flats.
