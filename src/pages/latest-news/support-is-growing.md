description: Labour MP Kim Johnson shows her support to Save Waterloo Dock.
---
You may be aware that the Save Waterloo Dock campaign has had ZERO support from our local Councillors. Our former MP, Louise Ellman, refused to object to the scheme to fill in the dock and build hundreds of flats on our behalf. 

We are delighted to report that our new Labour MP, Kim Johnson, who has already been in the job for a month has already added her voice to our campaign.

Kim's office has written to us to advise: "I can let you know that Kim has sent a letter to Liverpool City Council's Chief Executive Tony Reeves opposing the planning permission for Waterloo Dock on the following grounds:

1) It will have a negative impact upon the residential amenity of local residents.

2) It will jeopardise Liverpool's World Heritage Status by destroying the historic dock."

Our sincere thanks to Kim and her team.
