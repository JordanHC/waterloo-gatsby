---
 The millionaire speculators who want to fill in this most historic of docks have very deep pockets. So we need top quality legal advice if we are to stand any chance of halting their plans - and saving the cityâ€™s World Heritage Status. We have set up a JustGiving page and hope as many local people as possible will consider this a cause worth fighting for. Please give what you can afford.
