Our hard-working MP Kim Johnson once again visited Waterloo Quays and The Warehouse to reinforce her support for the Campaign to Save Waterloo Dock and to send Christmas greetings to all our community. 

Her objection to 21F/0377 was worthy and strong, demonstrating she has listened to our community's concerns and understands what's at stake. 

One resident says, "Here at Waterloo Dock, we appreciate what we have, a beautiful Grade II listed building sitting beside a historical Dock. We were gutted when we lost World Heritage Status. It's great to have someone like Kim, our MP, not only come and listen to us but to act and object to this destructive proposal."

Another resident, "During the first lockdown, we were able to, socially distanced, sit beside the Dock. I heard one report say, words to the effect, there was nothing in the Dock, effectively it was dead. Really? Our experience was of a beautiful blue space, alive with wildlife, canada geese; cormorants; swans; herons, shoals of fish. It's our only outside space - it's as important as green space and we shouldn't lose it to a ton of destructive concrete. Our waterfront deserves better." 

Resident, "I walk along the Dockside all the time, all weathers, it's good for our health and wellbeing, especially now with COVID, I think I've learned about its history, we appreciate it more, it's a treasure we shouldn't bury for the sake of a block of flats. Good on Kim for taking an interest."

A member of the Campaign team stated, "We've opposed this planning application for three years. At first, we were aghast to have the historical Waterloo Dock described as derelict.  We've been up against it - developers and landowners have money and power. It would be good to have more of a level playing field but we're resolute and it's a boost to morale to have someone like Kim in our corner with her sense of community and integrity.' 

OUR MESSAGE: SAY NO TO DOCK INFILL - NO TO PA 21F/0377
