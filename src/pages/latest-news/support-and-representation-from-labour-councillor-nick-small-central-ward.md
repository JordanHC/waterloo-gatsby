  Letter from Labour Councillor Nick Small writing to Peter Jones, case officer
  for planning application 18F/3247  Liverpool City Council Planning Department
  making representation on behalf of his constituents.

Peter

 

I am writing to make a representation on the above planning application. 

 

The application is for a development in Kirkdale Ward, but borders Central Ward.  I have contacted by residents living in Princes Dock in Central Ward concerned about the impact of application on their residential amenity and the impact of the application on the World Heritage Site, which covers both wards.  My representation is in this context.

 

The report currently being considered at the 43rd Session of the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger specifically mentions these proposals for West Waterloo Dock and states that the five Neighbourhood Masterplans for Liverpool Waters have not yet been reviewed and endorsed by UNESCO and advisory bodies alongside the proposed Tall Buildings Policy in the Draft Local Plan and proposed DSOCR in a comprehensive, joined-up and strategic context in order to preserve the OUV of the WHS and to avoid incremental overdevelopment.

 

I believe that this application ought to be considered in this wider overarching context by the Planning Committee and rejected or deferred until these policies and plans have been reviewed and endorsed by UNESCO and its advisory bodies and the Planning Committee fully understands the potential implications on the WHS.

 

Please include these comments in the Case Officerâ€™s Report and invite me to the speak at the Planning Committee meeting at which this application is to be determined.

 

Regards

 

Nick
