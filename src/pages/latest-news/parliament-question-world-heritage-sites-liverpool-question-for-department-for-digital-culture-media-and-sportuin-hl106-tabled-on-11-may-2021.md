**Question Lord Mike Storey**

To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of Historic England’s view that (1) the Liverpool Docks are the largest and most complete system of docks anywhere in the world, and (2) the infill of the West Waterloo Docks would harm Liverpool’s UNESCO World Heritage Status.



**Answer Baroness Barran.** Department for Digital, Culture,Media & Sport

20 May 2021

The Government recognises the importance of protecting Liverpool’s UNESCO World Heritage status, and the outstanding universal value for which the Liverpool Docks and the rest of the site were inscribed in 2004. We continue to value the advice of Historic England on all aspects of the United Kingdom’s implementation of the World Heritage Convention. We note Historic England’s opposition to the proposed development at West Waterloo Docks and will continue to work with all parties to protect the heritage of Liverpool.



**Many thanks to Councillor Richard Kemp for his continuing pursuance on behalf of Liverpool's World Heritage Status and his advocacy on behalf of West Waterloo Dock and City residents.**
