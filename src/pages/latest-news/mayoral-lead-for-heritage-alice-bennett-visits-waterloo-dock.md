THE Save Waterloo Dock campaign had a  welcome visitor recently. 

Despite it being one of the wettest days of this soggy summer, Mayoral Heritage Lead Alice Bennett spent almost two hours with members of the campaign team, on a fact-finding visit to the place we all call home. She studied the site, heard about the dock’s history, listened to our concerns and talked to us at length about heritage issues and the city’s attitude to development.

So far as we know, Alice is the first person from the Mayor’s top team to visit the site since our campaign began last Christmas. She listened patiently to what we had to say and confirmed that she has a wide grasp of heritage-related issues and challenges.

On behalf of everyone involved in this campaign, we would like to offer our sincere gratitude for her time, patience and advice.

Thank you, Alice.
