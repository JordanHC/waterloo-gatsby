We at SWD welcome the impending arrival of our new ISLE OF MAN FERRY TERMINAL. We have raised concern around the design/development of the new terminal. Those concerns are being listened to and investigated by the department of infrastructure on the island. At no point have we been ignored and we thank the Manx government and its officers for the respectful manner they have dealt with our concerns.

The Isle of Man and the people of the island are an integral part of Liverpool’s identity similarly the people of Ireland. We share the Irish Sea and the  Ferry’s. 

Historically our links are engrained in a tradition of maritime cooperation and the relationship between us solid and healthy. 

On arrival or dis-embarkation from the new terminal we want passengers to share in the wonders of West Waterloo Dock,  a  historical tourist attraction waiting to happen, alternatively just enjoy a mug of tea on one of the picnic benches along our dock. Regardless of anything we welcome our new neighbours with open arms.
