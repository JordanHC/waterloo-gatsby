Our three-year battle to save historic West Waterloo Dock won its biggest victory yet this morning.



The Liverpool City Council Planning Committee voted UNANIMOUSLY to accept the recommendation of its Planning Department and reject Planning Application 21F/0377 to build 330 flats on our dock.



Four members of the Save Waterloo Dock Campaign spoke at the meeting, as did the chair of the Waterloo Quays Tenants Association. Incredibly, there wasn’t a single contribution in favour of the plans.



The meeting was told that the developers have already launched an appeal on the grounds of “non determination”, and that the issue will now go to a public inquiry. 



So our campaign is not over yet.



But today’s verdict clearly shows that when people join forces in defence of their community, the powers that be have to listen.



Several of the councillors who spoke - including our own councillor Dave Hanratty and Nick Small from the neighbouring Central ward - praised the efforts of the Save Waterloo Dock campaign.



And one suggested that our efforts were “nothing short of a war”.



So sincere thanks go to everyone who has supported our campaign over the past three years.



Today we have won a major battle. With your support we now need to go on and win the war!
