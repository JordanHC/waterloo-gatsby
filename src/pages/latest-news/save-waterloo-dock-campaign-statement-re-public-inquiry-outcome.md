Waterloo Dock Liverpool L3

SAVE WATERLOO DOCK										

Planning Appeal:  APP/Z4310/W/21/3289762: Plot C02, L3 1DL



We are surprised and deeply disappointed by the Planning Inspector’s decision to uphold the developer’s appeal.  This is a Central Government decision, which fails to respect any of the wishes of the residents, the community, the Liverpool City planners, and the politicians in Liverpool.  All of these parties are united in opposition to this unfortunate development which fails to serve the needs of the community or the City.



For nearly four years Save Waterloo Dock has made clear its opposition to the infill of West Waterloo Dock to create a residential building site. This is fundamentally detrimental and wholly unnecessary for the city’s development and regeneration. Save Waterloo Dock fully supports redevelopment and regeneration for appropriate purposes including the new Isle of Man Ferry Terminal and this is spelled out clearly on our website.



We are pleased to have had strong and unanimous support in our efforts from Britain’s leading heritage organisations, namely: SAVE Britain’s Heritage, The Georgian Group, The Victorian Society and Historic England, as well as international organisations, Europa Nostra and World Heritage Watch. 



The loss of the UNESCO World Heritage Site designation as a consequence of inappropriate riverfront development has caused long-term reputational damage to Liverpool.  Save Waterloo Dock is concerned this disappointing decision does not create a precedent for any further dock infill.  Liverpool City Council was absolutely right to oppose this unfortunate development on heritage and policy grounds, and it seems utterly wrong that their decision has now been overturned in London.



At this time we are still considering our position and what actions may be available to us.



Notes:



Waterloo Dock dates from 1834 when Jesse Hartley, the world’s first full-time dock engineer, was expanding the docks northwards, and was modified in 1865 – 8 by City Engineer, George F. Lyster.  Three large grain warehouses were built of which only Waterloo Warehouse survives, turning the dock into the largest grain dock in the world. West Waterloo Dock was also the main point of departure throughout the rest of the 19th Century for emigrants to the “New World”.



SAVE Britain's Heritage has been campaigning for historic buildings since its formation in 1975.



The Georgian Group is an English and Welsh conservation organisation created to campaign for the preservation of historic buildings and planned landscapes of the 18th and early 19th centuries.

	

The Victorian Society campaigns to preserve and promote interest in Victorian and Edwardian architecture and heritage.



Europa Nostra is the leading citizen’s group to protect and celebrate Europe’s Cultural and natural heritage.



World Heritage Watch is a global voice of civil society for world heritage and ensures that the world heritage is not sacrificed to political compromises and political interests.



Save Waterloo Dock is a local neighbourhood association seeking to ensure that development of Waterloo Dock is appropriate and not destructive.
