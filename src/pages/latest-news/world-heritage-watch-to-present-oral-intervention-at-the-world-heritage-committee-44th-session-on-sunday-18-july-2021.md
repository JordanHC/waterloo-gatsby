# **WORLD HERITAGE WATCH**

# **Oral intervention on Item 7B.34**

Thank you giving us the floor, Mr. Chair. World Heritage Watch makes this intervention on behalf of two civil society organizations from Liverpool.



Save Waterloo Dock and Engage Liverpool represent residents and others determined to protect and preserve the integrity of the historic waterfront and city centre, and resist inappropriate development in the World Heritage Site and Buffer Zone.  We deplore the failure of developers, Liverpool City Council and the State Party to respect and protect the OUV of the property and the requirements of the World Heritage Convention.



Many ordinary citizens in Liverpool hold the World Heritage designation in the highest esteem. The damage to reputation and prestige of our city, and the very significant adverse economic consequences its loss would cause, would be especially unfortunate as efforts are made to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. 



Important changes have begun within Liverpool City Council signalling a real shift towards a more collaborative approach to UNESCO, and commitments to uphold the OUV of the entire WHS. We support the call from the State Party for a deferral of the decision and endorse the proposals made by Save Britainâ€™s Heritage to the Department of Culture, Media and Sports.  We hope a resultant tightening of planning regulation as applied to Liverpool would ensure that past mistakes are not repeated. 



The real regret for many is that if this decision to delete Liverpool goes ahead today then those who have done most damage to the OUV of the site will be the ones who ultimately benefit, and the efforts of those who have campaigned in support of the UNESCO designation will have been in vain.



Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
