  Email to Lesley Woodridge Liverpool City Council - consultees and who is going
  to BAKU 43rd UNESCO conference.

An email has been sent out to Lesley Woodridge of Liverpool City Council, once again asking her for information, please see below:



Lesley Woodridge, Liverpool City Council



Firstly, the enquiry about your participation as a named consultee on Peels outline consent. We have evidence of irregular activity on that application and the current application 18F/3247. We ask again are you aware you are a named consultee and do you recall what that consultation amounted to?



In your email of June 13 ​2019 y​o​u state attendance of council employees/politicians and any other stakeholders (engage) at the Baku UNESCO 43rd conference is under consideration. 



Given the conference begins next week and registering for participation ended on June 1st 2019 we would expect a decision has now been made. We are aware of LCC s commitment to save our WHS and we share that ambition. 



We note your attendance at the 42nd UNESCO conference along with other local stakeholders. We expect the cabinet report of 22nd Febuary ​2019, which strangely was submitted to UNESCO on the 11 Febuary ​2019 would require significant clarification of our City's intent with regards to our WHS.



We have now established significant support/ contacts within the UNESCO organisation and we could possibly facilitate an informal get together of LCC chosen  attendee​s' and one of our contacts. Obviously ​we would need to know who's going and if such a meeting would be appropriate. At the very least could you provide us with the names of any persons who will be attending on behalf of LCC. 



Regards
