  RESIDENTS ANGUISH AT THE CONSTANT STEAM OF IMAGES BY MEDIA MOGULS THAT DO NOT
  REPRESENT THE REALITY OF PROPOSED DESTRUCTIVE DEVELOPMEN​T

The second image is a prediction of the future - a media moguls perception, effectively fake news. Not to scale. Waterloo Warehouse, in the background is 5 storeys high. The proposed development in front is going to be between 10-14 storeys high. Yet the front blocks look of a lesser height than the Warehouse, with the bigger two structures looking a similar trajectory. This is fake.

Anyone can see the density of the proposal and Waterloo Quays apartments have more or less disappeared.
