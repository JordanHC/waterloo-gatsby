  Save Waterloo Dock ask councillors to support the chief planning officer's
  recommendation to refuse planning application 21F/0377 and bolster the
  planning committee with us on 18 January 2022 to protect our world-renowned
  maritime and mercantile heritage and waterfront.

Dear Councillor:



Back in 2013 all politicians in Liverpool were consulted on Peel Holdings outline planning permission for Liverpool Waters. Here at Save Waterloo Dock we would like to take the opportunity  to inform you of a critical planning application, (PA 21F/0377) now confirmed to go to the Planning Committee on 18 January 2022. This development was not included in Peel’s outline planning permission so in fact all politicians have not been consulted regarding this application.



The Planning Committee’s decision will send out a clear message of the City’s intent with regard to our world-renowned maritime and mercantile heritage and waterfront. Our heritage assets cannot remain locked in the past and  developments which achieve an appropriate and viable purpose such as the IOM Ferry terminal  or the cruise ship terminal should not be opposed.



However, the planning application 21F/0377 has absolutely no prior justification and any approval to infill an historic dock just to build 330 residential units is an insult to our heritage.



There is cross-party opposition to this development. We invite you to visit our website for further information and join the growing list of politicians, national heritage organisations and members of the local community in opposing this planning application.  



The Interim Chief Planning Officer is recommending refusal based on a thorough and exhaustive analysis.  Our Neighbourhood Association applauds this recommendation. 



We ask you to  support the members of the Planning Committee in urging them to refuse this inappropriate and problematic planning application.   



Regards,



Save Waterloo Dock 

Neighbourhood Association
