Our research team are doing great in preparation for our challenge in terms of what we believe is a flawed process and if it comes to it, judicial review.

We are now aware that Historic England wrote to Liverpool City Council in January 2019, a six page warning, in summary it highlighted:

‘We consider that the public benefits which the residential development may achieve could be achieved through other means without causing harm to the heritage assets including the World Heritage Site. We are therefore raising serious concerns about the application and consider it requires notification to DCMS (Department of Culture, Media and Sports) as set out in circular 02/09: The Town and Country Planning (Consultation) (England) Direction 2009, so that they can consider whether to send a Paragraph 172 notification to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre in line with the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention.’

Also:

‘...taking all this into account, we are of the opinion that the development would cause a high level of harm to West Waterloo Dock and to the OUV’, (OUTSTANDING UNIVERSAL VALUE) of the world heritage site and the setting of the adjacent conservation area, causing us serious concerns’.

**Historic England 21 January 2019**

Our research is uncovering many serious concerns ourselves.

The good news is that there is a delay in the planning process whilst the impact on WHS is reassessed but we wont be taking our foot off the pedal.

We have consistently presented that we are not against development, we are excited about the North side development. It’s long overdue but destroy a historical dock? On 0.5 hectares of land, no bigger than a football pitch when they have 60 hectares to play with - its destructive and unnecessary.

Land owners; Planners and Council should know we are fighters; tenacious and passionate about our Heritage; Our City; Our community; Our home. We know that Liverpool people are too. Scousers want growth; we are not stupid; we can see benefits of a good and thriving economy but we also know that there is no need to destroy the old to develop the new. It should go hand in hand.

Our site has been described as dilapidated and derelict. Only someone who doesn’t care; is paid for an opinion; or hasn’t come and observed this beautiful site could say that. It’s our home, how dare they!

The only part that is neglected is that which PEEL has left to neglect; It’s a dock; it looks like a dock; its neither derelict or dilapidated - its a beautiful part of our overall dockland area. It should not be destroyed.
