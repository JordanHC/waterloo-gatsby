_'West Waterloo Dock played a very significant role in the City's racial history - not as a dock actually used for slaves but one that was hugely important to the City's slavemasters. As the fastest route across the Atlantic - effectively the Concorde of those days - rich people opted for the comfort and speed of the US packet ships to visit their plantations in the southern United States. Every packet ship was based in West Waterloo Dock.'_
