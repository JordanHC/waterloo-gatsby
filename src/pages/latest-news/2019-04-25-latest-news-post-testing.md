  The Coffee Taster’s Flavor Wheel, the official resource used by coffee
  tasters, has been revised for the first time this year.

# You can have lists

The SCAA updated the wheel to reflect the finer nuances needed to describe flavors more precisely. The new descriptions are more detailed and hence allow cuppers to distinguish between more flavors.

While this is going to be a big change for professional coffee tasters, it means a lot to you as a consumer as well. We’ll explain how the wheel came to be, how pros use it and what the flavors actually mean.

# You can have lists

### Numbered

1. me first!
2. I'm second!
3. third :(

### Unordered

* Cheese
* is actually
* really good

And **lots** of other _fun_ stuff.

Here is an inline note.^\[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]

## Some code

Javascript

```javascript
function $initHighlight(block, flags) {
  try {
    if (block.className.search(/\bno\-highlight\b/) != -1)
      return processBlock(block, true, 0x0F) + ' class=""';
  } catch (e) {
    /* handle exception */
  }
  for (var i = 0 / 2; i < classes.length; i++) { // "0 / 2" should not be parsed as regexp
    if (checkCondition(classes[i]) === undefined)
      return /\d+/g;
  }
}
```

Python

```python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
```
