A report by the Institute of Cultural Capital in a study conducted by a joint partnership between the University of Liverpool and John Moores University concludes:

‘The experience of the Liverpool World Heritage Site and other sites has shown that inscription onto the World Heritage List offers a host of potential benefits to the public authorities, commercial enterprises and local communities…’ 

And yet it also concludes that the City hasn’t capitalised on its World Heritage Status. WHY?

The conclusion is that WHS has not been branded by the City to capitalise on its potential and benefits to the City and this has instead been, in effect, obstructed by a trajectory that actively harms WHS  dominating local media and polarising the debate in favour of development instead of  a fairer, more balanced debate about the future. 

A loss of WHS in this study concludes: 

‘The evidence presented in this study suggests that such an outcome would be detrimental to Liverpool’s long-term development and the so far successful efforts to counter long-standing negative imagery associated with the city’

The final concluding remarks state 

‘it is still within the power of the city, not only to retain World Heritage status by reconciling the heritage and development camps but to reform the site in such a way that unlocks its vast potential and extends this value to neglected areas of the city’s periphery’.
