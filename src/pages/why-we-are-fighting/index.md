### To Save West Waterloo Dock

![West Waterloo Dock](/img/64996361_10214495661289243_6983668629191524352_n.jpg "West Waterloo Dock - Now")

At the end of 2018 a planning proposal 18F/3247 was submitted to Liverpool City Council. It proposed to infill most of the historic West Waterloo Dock in order to build six, high rise blocks of 646 apartments, which would almost totally obscure the views of the historic, Grade II listed Waterloo Warehouse from the river and the Wirral. Heritage vandalism on a truly epic scale. This proposal has now been updated (December 2019) - the proposal is to erect 4 10 storey blocks of 538 apartments with ground floor commercial space.

This updated proposal continues to go against all the Heritage pledges in the Liverpool Local Plan 2013-2033 and most of the undertakings in the Liverpool City Council World Heritage Site Supplementary Planning Document in support of World Heritage status.  It seems inconceivable that it will not put the already at risk World Heritage status in even graver jeopardy.

The images below show the proposal and the planned site infill.
