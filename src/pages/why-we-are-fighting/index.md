### To Save West Waterloo Dock

At the end of last year (2018) a planning proposal 18F/3247 was submitted to Liverpool City Council. It proposes to infill most of the historic West Waterloo Dock in order to build six, high rise blocks of 646 apartments, which will almost totally obscure the views of the historic, Grade II listed Waterloo Warehouse from the river and the Wirral. 

Heritage vandalism on a truly epic scale. 

This proposal goes against all the Heritage pledges in the Liverpool Local Plan 2013-2033 and most of the undertakings in the Liverpool City Council World Heritage Site Supplementary Planning Document in support of World Heritage status.  It seems inconceivable that it will not put the already at risk World Heritage status in even graver jeopardy.
