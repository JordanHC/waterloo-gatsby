### Sign Our Petition!

http://chng.it/QMNVkJfrms

At the end of last year, planning proposal 18F/3247 was submitted to Liverpool City. It proposes to infill most of the historic West Waterloo Dock in order to build six, high rise blocks of 646 apartments, which will almost totally obscure the views of the historic, Grade II listed Waterloo Warehouse from the river and the Wirral. Heritage vandalism on a truly epic scale. 

### Write to Liverpool City Council

Please write to Liverpool City Council with your objections to planning application 18F/3247 with regards to the infill of West Waterloo Dock. You can also do this online at Liverpool.gov.uk quoting the application number.
