  Kolkata, the only other city in the world that has the exact Warehouse

Below is a letter recently written to the local paper  to expresss concern following articles about development that would see an infill of the historic west waterloo dock.

Dear Sir /Madam

I am writing to express my concern regarding developments such as the one detailed in your above article. My concerns are intensely personal but may have resonance with other Scousers. I grew up in Kolkata. It is the only other city in the world that has the exact Warehouse architecture as Liverpool built in 1901. Same time as Tobacco Warehouse. When the previous Prime minister visited India he also drove down the River front. There was a tentative agreement that the two government's would look at the restoration of the Victorian architecture with a moratorium on new building. On the other side of the River Hooghly there were French and Dutch and Portuguese settlements. All three governments have been involved in restoring their buildings. One of the Kolkata Warehouse is now a Maritime museum which refers to the architectural link with Liverpool.

The transformation of that Victorian Waterfront into Sydney in Liverpool city centre however will struggle to receive a place in that narrative

Yours sincerely
