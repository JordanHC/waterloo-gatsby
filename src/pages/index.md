    To Save West Waterloo Dock. One of the great docks that grew out of
    Liverpool’s transformation from a backwater town trading with Ireland, to
    the dominant mercantile city of an Empire. Together let’s put a stop to the
    planned development (18F/3247) which proposes to infill most of the historic
    West Waterloo Dock in order to build six, high rise blocks of 646
    apartments.

    Designed by Jesse Hartley to accommodate large sailing ships, it mainly
    focused on the transatlantic trade between Liverpool and the USA and West
    Indies. These links with the USA made Waterloo the ideal location for ALL
    the American Packet Ships (so-called because they carried packets of mail)
    and these, in turn, became the main carriers of human traffic in the early
    years of transatlantic travel..
